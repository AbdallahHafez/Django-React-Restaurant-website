# I created this website from scratch using Djanog , Djanogrestframework, React , and simpleJWT for authentication

# If you want to run this website locally you need to have node moduels with necessary packages in order to react to work .

# I integrated both frontend (react) , and backend(django), so it you want to run this project locally , you need to run it through django using python manage.py runsrerver command

# Features of the project:

1- Users can display all foods stored on database on a page, and user can display  more info about specific food through clicking view button of food card

2- User can reserve a table and see all of his previous reservation , on reservation section , but in order to do that he needs to register first as he will only display his
reservations that's why you will find reservation route is a protected route

3- authentication system using simpleJWT package
